## Potential speaker and mentor email

Hey [potential speaker]

We hope things have been going well for you since your CTFED's talk with us and all the other talks you've given since :slightly_smiling_face:

So the reason we're sending you this ping out of the blue is we're trying to get something a little different going for our speaker talks lately. In an effort to encourage a more diverse speaker line up we're trying to match more experienced industry peeps with more junior peeps, to get a presentation mentorship thing going. Our last talk co-presented by [past speakers] was a super successful example of this: [link to Meetup event]

We know co-presenting a talk with another person is definitely more work than just presenting something by yourself, but we think you'd make an excellent mentor [potential speaker]. If you have the time and the energy, would you consider pairing up with someone who counts as underrepresented in tech to co-present a CTFED's talk. As always, we'll be on hand to help with feedback for dry runs, and we can connect you with a mentee if you can't think of someone to pair with.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Regards,
team CTFED's (Dani, Steve & Justin)
