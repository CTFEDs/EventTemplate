Talk at CTFEDs?

# Body

Hi! :)

`intro saying hi and stuff`

Short version: **would you give a talk at CTFEDs later this year? :)**

Long version below.

---

We are looking for speakers for our CTFEDs (Cape Town Front-end Developers) [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/) for this year. We meet after work on the first Wednesday of the month (although when we do workshops we do them on a Saturday morning) and we’ve got open slots from June onwards. Would you be interested in speaking? :)

```
Why this person? List at least two things showing them they are awesome and would do a great job. Some ideas below.

- Do they know about a topic that’d be a good fit?
- Do they want to learn about a topic that’d be a good fit?
- Are they working on a project that would make a great case study?
- Are they new to FED?
- Do they want to get better public speaking?
- Do they have experience talking or a running workshop? (Not necessary: more about confidence and familiarity)
```

If you would like some help, we would be very happy to help! We can help with the topic, the talk or workshop itself, help you practice, and more. We’ve got a [Call For Speakers page](http://ctfeds.org/call-for-speakers/) that has a bunch more words about this.

Let me know! :)

Regards,

`{{ me }} (& {{ Danielle & Justin & Steve }})`
