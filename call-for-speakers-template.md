Would you give a talk at the CTFEDs meetup?

# Body

Hi! :)

`intro saying hi and stuff`

Short version: would you give a talk at the CTFEDs meetup? `Elevator pitch on why them or what topic or both` :)

Examples / ideas:

- We think you'd be great to give on a talk on React since you're learning it right now.
- Since you're newish to Front-end, you're in the perfect position to help other people in the same situation. And to remind the old ones what they've forgotten!
- We think your persective (as a mostly back-end developer) would give helpful insights to front-enders working with back-enders.

Long version below.

We would love you to come and speak at our CTFEDs (Cape Town Front-end Developers) [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/). We feel that speaking can be a bit initimidating, so we offer as much help as we can. We can help with the topic, the talk (or workshop), help you practice, and more. Weâ€™ve got a [Call For Speakers page](http://ctfeds.org/call-for-speakers/) that has a bunch more words about this.

`Why this person? Expand on the elevator pitch above.`

Examples / ideas:

- You know a bunch about `tech-thing` and we think our audience would love to hear about that.
- If there's a new thing you want to learn about (e.g. `tech-thing`), giving a talk is a great way to get into it.
- Case studies are always great. Seeing concrete examples of applying ideas helps people understand what something is all about. "This is how we set up our gulp file. This is how we used flexbox. This is how we kept out HTML accessible."
- If you want to get better at public speaking, we offer support and a crowd of friendly faces to talk to.

The CTFEDs meetups are at about 6.30pm on the first Wednesday of the month (although when we do workshops we do them on a Saturday). Talks usually last about half an hour (and workshop normally a few hours).

Let me know! :)
