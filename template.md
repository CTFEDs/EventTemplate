## About the talk

* In my first web developer job, I found myself having to learn a framework which seemed completely alien to me: React - The javascript library for building user interfaces. The talk aims to elaborate more on why one would use React (and Flux) and how to go about implementing it for the first time (Not recommended for those who are in love with pure HTML).
