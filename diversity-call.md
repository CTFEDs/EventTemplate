I will be hosting a workshop on *to be determined* in *to be determined*. In line with our mandate at CTFEDs to promote diversity (https://ctfeds.org/call-for-speakers/#diversity) I'm interested in either tag-teaming this with an established front-end developer of different gender, ethnicity, orientation and/or ability than me. Alternatively, I'm happy to also use this as an opportunity to mentor someone interested in learning more about CSS so that they are able to present a lot of the material by themselves.
