We’re continuing to use meetup's messaging functionality while we look for a better way to keep you notified about RSVPs and things.

If you haven’t done so already, please make sure that you have notifications turned on for the website (under [Settings > Email Updates > CTFEDs](http://www.meetup.com/account/comm/ctfeds/)) and for the native app if you use it. Please also add meetup.com messages to your contacts (`info@meetup.com` and `messages@meetup.com` are both used) so that the mails don’t get filed under Junk by mistake.

Thank you!
