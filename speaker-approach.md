Hi [Name]

Hope you are well. 

My name is [Name] and I am a co-founder / organsier of Front-end Developers South Africa, a registered non-profit organisation supporting the advancement of design and front-end front-end development in South Africa. We run bi-monthly design and front-end focused meetups and workshops since 2012.

In 2020 we moved online of necessity and started a Q & A format. This is a 45 min Zoom session where you introduce yourself and attendees ask you questions related to the work that you do (very much just off the cuff/no preparation expected).

We were wondering if you would be interested in participating in such a session? In 2020 we hosted Brad Frost, Chris Coyier and Jason Miller. These sessions are up on our YouTube channel. (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9OPkQ9s2vClY992NzPgqEKNBh3eTaJ0y).

As we are a non-profit and have literally no money this would be pro bono. I just want to be upfront that I'd completely understand if this isn't the type of thing that you do - I thought I'd just reach out to see.

You can read more about us and see our previous events on Meetup - https://www.meetup.com/fedsa-community/

Thanks and regards
