Hello!

Thanks for getting in touch.

The CTFEDs organising team don't really get involved in recruitment things. Your best bet is either to post your job on LinkedIn, or to post about the position in the ZA Tech (you can sign up at https://zatech-slackin.herokuapp.com/) or ZA Dev (you need an invite from a member) Slack groups. Both have job / recruitment channels for just this sort of thing.

Hope this helps :).

Regards,

Justin & Steve
