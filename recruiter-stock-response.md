Hello!

Thanks for getting in touch.

The FEDSA organising team don't really get involved in recruitment things. Your best bet is either to post your job on LinkedIn, or to post about the position in the ZA Tech Slack group (you can sign up at https://zatech.co.za/). It has a #jobpostings channel for just this sort of thing.

Hope this helps :).


Regards,

Justin & Schalk & Shailen
